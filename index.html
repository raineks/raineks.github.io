            Starting my journey at Trent in 2015, I had a plan to dive head first into cultural anthropology and linguistics. Not knowing then the ever-growing world of archaeology, and my plans would change drastically. 
            Since then I have had the great opportubnity to work alongside my professors at Trent excavations and analyses for the Nassau Mills site on Trent's campus over the course of three years.

            Since then I have had the great opportubnity to work alongside my professors at Trent excavations and analyses for the Nassau Mills site on Trent's campus over the course of three years, 2 out in the field and the last generating a report analysing ceramics found at the site.

                Working on the Nassau Mills site from the beginning until the end was a highly educational experience. Through this field scholl I was able to apply the knowledge from lectures in identifying artifacts and analysing the stratigraphy on site.
                Through this experience I have gained a thorough understanding of the Archaeological Standards and Guidelines, the ability to formulate efficient field notes and later utilise those in a report.
                Myself alongside a couple student colleges (Andrea Mambro & Brianne Glaves) completed a field report based on the stage 3 Operation Areas within the Nassau Mills field school (BcGn-23) of contexts and artifacts recovered, identifying and examining ceramics, and Ground Penetrating Radar survey.

                At ASI I was given the opportunity to work on a Lithic and Bone site, contrary to my previous field school. This was a highly educational experience, as lithics can be more difficult to identify from the soil than in class. 
                Here I gained a knowledge base of identifying human-modified lithics, and animal bone and continued to increase my field notes and artifact organization skills.
