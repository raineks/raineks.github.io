              Starting my journey at Trent in 2015, I had a plan to dive head first into cultural anthropology and linguistics. Not knowing then the ever-growing world of archaeology, and my plans would change drastically. 
            Since then I have had the great opportubnity to work alongside my professors at Trent excavations and analyses for the Nassau Mills site on Trent's campus over the course of three years, 2 out in the field and the last generating a report analysing ceramics found at the site.

                Working on the Nassau Mills site from the beginning until the end was a highly educational experience. Through this field scholl I was able to apply the knowledge from lectures in identifying artifacts and analysing the stratigraphy on site.
                Through this experience I have gained a thorough understanding of the Archaeological Standards and Guidelines, the ability to formulate efficient field notes and later utilise those in a report.
                Myself alongside a couple student colleges (Andrea Mambro & Brianne Glaves) completed a field report based on the stage 3 Operation Areas within the Nassau Mills field school (BcGn-23) of contexts and artifacts recovered, identifying and examining ceramics, and Ground Penetrating Radar survey.

                At ASI I was given the opportunity to work on a Lithic and Bone site, contrary to my previous field school. This was a highly educational experience, as lithics can be more difficult to identify from the soil than in class. 
                Here I gained a knowledge base of identifying human-modified lithics, and animal bone and continued to increase my field notes and artifact organization skills.
