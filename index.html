          Starting my journey at Trent in 2015, I had a plan to dive head first into cultural anthropology and linguistics. Not knowing then the ever-growing world of archaeology, and my plans would change drastically. 
          Since then I have had the great opportubnity to work alongside my professors at Trent excavations and analyses for the Nassau Mills site on Trent's campus over the course of three years.
