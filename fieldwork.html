            The Stage 3 archaeological assessment of Nassau Mills complex (BcGn-23) is conducted by means of test unit excavation. Such assessments typically include outcomes like a recommendation that an avoidance and protection strategy be implemented. A recommendation that controlled excavations be conducted, as well as recommendation of no further assessment. In order to objectively determine whether an archaeological site has cultural heritage value or interest, a systemic approach is undertaken in the manner consistent with fieldwork standards as defined in section 3.1 of the Standards and Guidelines for Consulting Archaeologists. A Stage 3 site-specific assessment begins with the establishment of a permanent datum that can be tied to a development map, the documentation of all field conditions and follow test pit assessment in order to show that parts of the site have been heavily disturbed with the addition of fill, capping the Euro-Canadian cultural material.
            The image (left) shows the main operatational ara (red) and two additional units (blue & green) excavated by myself and a few student colleges after completeing a GPR survey across the entire field.

            The image (left) shows the Haggersville site long before test units, or stage 4 excavation began. The section highlighted in purple is a fraction of the whole site, where the crew I was a part of was focused.
            The purpose of this site was to perform an archaeological survey to determine the possibility of moving foward with construction. It resulted in a Stage 4 excavation where many lithics and soil anomolies were discovered.
