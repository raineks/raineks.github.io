     The Stage 3 archaeological assessment of Nassau Mills complex (BcGn-23) is conducted by means of test unit excavation. Such assessments typically include outcomes like a recommendation that an avoidance and protection strategy be implemented. A recommendation that controlled excavations be conducted, as well as recommendation of no further assessment. In order to objectively determine whether an archaeological site has cultural heritage value or interest, a systemic approach is undertaken in the manner consistent with fieldwork standards as defined in section 3.1 of the Standards and Guidelines for Consulting Archaeologists. A Stage 3 site-specific assessment begins with the establishment of a permanent datum that can be tied to a development map, the documentation of all field conditions and follow test pit assessment in order to show that parts of the site have been heavily disturbed with the addition of fill, capping the Euro-Canadian cultural material.
